# Hotel-Management
Project for OOP course at Sofia University, "St. Kliment Ohridski"

The "Date" class holds basic functions for creating, comparing dates and and also for printing them in ISO 8601.

The "Room" class holds information about each room(room number, beds and reservation). In addition it  gives us the opportunity to work with the reservations (add, check out), we can set the room for unavailable and see when it is free. 

The "Manager" class works with given/default files. It holds the functions, which help to convert the user input to different types of data(function names, objects, numbers, etc) as well. All the operations, needed for the project, are declared there, but in their definitions are used member functions from the "Room" class for a more readable code. 

The file with the rooms is previously given. One text file (rooms.txt) will be attached, which can be used as default or as a template.
